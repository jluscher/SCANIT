# SCANIT
Control for a fluorescent spectrometer

This project was started to create a software package to control a fluorescent spectrometer and collect data.  The spectrometer is owned by the US Forest Products Laboratory, located at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI.

This spectrometer is an older one, no longer supported by its manufacturer, and as the electronics became 'iffy' a new electronic controller was designed and built by the University's Physical Sciences Laboratory (PSL) located in Stoughton, WI.

I (James Luscher) agreed to write the software needed to interface to this new controller, taking the place of the original manufacturer's program (written for DOS) which would not, of course, work with the newly designed electronics.

The original agreement with Forest Products Lab was for the software to be open source (as shown in the license for this project).

Difficulties with funding my work arose however and now that the University of Wisconsin has agreed to fund the software work their (new) agreement requires that "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: UNIVERSITY SHALL OWN ALL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN ANY AGREEMENT CREATED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT".

For this reason I have published SCANIT at this point, adhering to the previously agreed upon open source license, and further work for FPL and UW will begin with this open sourced verison (v37) but subsequent work, called "ScanFPL" will be closed source and the property of the University of Wisconsin.

I hope that this preliminary work, done as open source, will be of use to others, either for further development of spectrometer controllers or as a source of GUI code in Tkinter and Python 3.
